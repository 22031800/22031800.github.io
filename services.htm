<h3>Sim Cards</h3>

<p>Sim Cards are small chips that when inserted into your mobile phone allow make and receive texts and calls, as well as use data.</p>
<p>Without a Sim Card none of these actions are possible. Once always physical, now embedded digital cards built into the phone are available, known as eSIMs.</p>

<h3>Phone Insurance</h3>

<p>Phone Insurance is a policy that covers the cost of repairing or replacing your phone if it becomes damaged, lost or even stolen.<p/>
<p>The majority of phone insurance claims are linked to cracked or falty screens, which if insured can be replaced at no extra charge.</p>
<p>Though not necessary, phone insurance is highly recommended in case of uncertain events.<p/> 
<p>Most phone manufacturer's offer their own insurance plans to customers.</p>

<h3>Phone Repairs</h3>

<p>Eventually even mobile phones often require some type of repairs.</p> 
<p>Most of the time repairs for mobile phones are due to a fault in the touch screen, be it a crack or some technical error. But it could even have something to do with the battery life or the phone’s speakers.</p>
